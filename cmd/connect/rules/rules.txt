Use only the following context to answer the user's question.

If you don't know the answer, say that you don't know. Be concise.

Output only a JSON blob only with the following schema that incorporates all three
questions into the same document and don't provide any other additonal information
or notes.

[
    {  
        "q": <integer>,  
        "rows": [<string>],  
        "count": <integer>,  
    }
]

Use the field 'q' to represent the question number.
Use the field 'row' to represent a row label.
Use the field 'count' to represent the number of rows.

Context:

The following provides rows with labels separated by a ':' that contain
a sequence of 4 words separated by a comma.

D1: Empty,Blue,Empty,Empty

E1: Empty,Empty,Red,Red

E2: Empty,Red,Red,Blue

E3: Red,Red,Blue,Empty

E4: Red,Blue,Empty,Empty

F1: Empty,Red,Blue,Blue

F2: Red,Blue,Blue,Blue

F3: Blue,Blue,Blue,Empty

F4: Blue,Blue,Empty,Empty

Question:

These are the rules for matching:
To match a sequence of the 4 words in any row, you must compare each word in the
row with each word in the input string. Only compare words at the same index
position. Each word is separated by a comma. If all 4 words in the row match all
4 words in the input string you have a match.

1. Using this input string (Empty,Blue,Blue,Blue) which rows match based on the
rules for matching?

2. Using this input string (Blue,Blue,Blue,Empty) which rows match based on the
rules for matching?

System:

You are a game assistant that answers questions about a game of connect four. You
will be given game context and questions about the game.

Context:

The game board consists of a grid with 7 columns and 6 rows.

The columns are labeled from 1 - 7 from left to right and the rows are labled A - F from top to bottom.

Inside the grid there are elements that can contain 1 of 3 different words: 'empty', 'blue', or 'red'.

The '|' symbol is used to separate the 7 different columns in each row.

The following is every row in the game board starting with row A and ending in row F.

|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|

|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|

|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|empty|

|empty|empty|empty|red|blue|empty|empty|

|empty|empty|red|blue|red|empty|empty|

|empty|empty|red|blue|blue|red|empty|

Question:

1. Check each row from the bottom (F) to top (A), can you find rows that have
3 'blue' elements? Provide the rows you found.

If any rows were found in the first question answer this next question.

2. Can you find a row using only the rows that were found in the first question
that have 2 'empty' elements? Provide the rows you found.

3. Check each row from the bottom (F) to top (A), can you find rows that have
3 'red' elements? Provide the rows you found.

If any rows were found in the third question answer this next question.

2. Can you find a row using only the rows that were found in the third question
that have 2 'empty' elements? Provide the rows you found.

5. If no rows were found in the forth question,
check each row from the bottom (F) to top (A), what is the first row and
element number you find with an empty space?
